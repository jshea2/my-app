# OBSosc (v2.1)
## Setup
*Download and Install: [obs-websocket](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/releases)*



- Configure the input fields 
- Successfully "Connect" 
- The window will open a "DevTools" window
     - Make sure it's on the "Console" tab, not "Elements"
- In the "Console" tab it will log IP and Port info, the number of available scenes, and a list of all scenes with numbers 
  - This can be used as an index argument in your **/scene** OSC message
- To save a config file with "Save As" please "Connect" first
- When you close OBSosc it will save your configuration for when you open next
- There is an option in 'File > Automatically Connect on Startup' that if enabled will automatically connect on opening OBSosc

## Application OSC -> OBSosc 

- In your OSC Application (QLab for example) patch your targeted OSC to match the "OSC IN" inputs on OBSosc.
  - default is... IP: `127.0.0.1`, Port: `3333`
- **DO NOT** Use UNDERSCORES in OBS. Only use them in your OSC Address. So, If your OBS Scene or Source name contains a SPACE, then in your OSC message replace the SPACE with an UNDERSCORE.
  - *Example:* if OBS Scene name is `Scene 1`, then your OSC address should use `Scene_1`.
    - *Note:* If OBS names contain UNDERSCORES this will not work. 
- OBSosc can be used for any application that transmits and/or receives unbundled OSC. 
  - This was designed with QLab, so the example show file of all the OSC commands is available in Assets on the Github or in the downloaded folder: "Qlab OBSosc Examples.qlab4" 
    - **Note:** Sending OSC Commands requires a paid version of Qlab.
 
#
# OSC Command List:

## **- Trigger Scenes: -**
#

### by Name in Argument
**`/scene [scene name]`** 
- activate a scene by name in the OSC argument. 
    - *Example:* **`/scene Wide`** will activate a scene named "Wide" in OBS. 
   - *Note:* SPACES will work ok for this format, so `/scene Webcam 1` is valid syntax
   - In QLab you can use quotations to wrap into a single argument: `/scene "Webcam 1"`

### by Index as Scene
**`/scene [index number]`** 
- activate a scene with the index associated from the logged list. 
    - *Example:* `/scene 1` will activate the first scene in OBS.
  - *Note:* Floats will be rounded down.
    - *Example:* `/scene 1.9` = `/scene 1`

### by Name in Address
**`/scene/[scene_name]`** 
- activate a scene by name in the OSC address. 
  - *Example:* `/scene/Wide` will activate a scene named "Wide" in OBS. 
  - *Note:* If a scene name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a scene "Webcam 1" make OSC message: `/scene/Webcam_1`
  
### Next Scene
**`/go`**  
- activates the next scene in the list, if this is triggered on the last scene it will go to the first scene

###  Previous Scene
**`/back`**  
- activates the previous scene in the list, if this is triggered on the first scene it will go to the last scene

#
## **- Set Transition Type and Duration: -**
#
**`/[type]/transition [duration]`**  
- sets the desired transition and duration(in milliseconds).
  - *Example:* `/Cut/transition` will change the current Scene Transition to "Cut". `/Fade/transition 5000` will set the current Scene Transition to "Fade" with a "5000" millisecond duration (5 seconds). 
    - *Note:* `[type]` must be identical to Transition Type name in OBS:
      - `Fade`, `Cut`, `Stinger`, `Fade_to_Color`, `Luma_Wipe`, `Slide`, `Swipe`, and Custom Transition Names. This also works with the `Move` [plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move-transition.913/).
    - If you do not set a duration in the 1st argument it will keep the current duration and log what it is.
#
## **- Set Source Visibility On/Off: -**
#
**`/[scene_name]/[source_name]/visible [0, off, false or 1, on, true]`** 
- turn on or off the source's visibility. 
  - *Example:* `/Webcam_1/Audio_Input_Capture/visible 0` will turn OFF "Audio Input Capture" source in OBS from scene "Webcam 1". Where as `/Webcam_1/Text_1/visible 1` will turn it ON. 
  - *NOTE:* If a scene name or source name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a scene "Webcam 1" and a source name of "Text 1" make OSC message the example from above.
#
## **- Set Filter Visibility On/Off: -**
#
**`/[scene_name]/[source_name]/filterVisibility [0, off, false or 1, on, true]`** 
- turn on or off the source's filter visibility.
  -  *Example:* `/Video_Input/Color_Correction/filterVisibiltity 0` will turn OFF filter named "Color Correction" in OBS from source "Video Input". Where as `/Video_Input/Color_Correction/filterVisibility 1` will turn it ON. 
  - *Note:* If a filter name or source name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a filter "Color Correction" and a source name of "Video Input" make OSC message the example from above.

#
## **- Set Text: -**
#
**`/[source_name] [text content] [size(optional)] [font (optional)]`**

  - *Example:* `/Text_1/Color_Correction/opacity 0.5` will make "Text 1" half transparent. 
  - *Note:* If a source name or filter name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a source "Text 1" and filter "Color Correction" make OSC message the example from above)
#
## **- Set "Color Correction" Filter Properties: -**
#
### Gamma
**`/[source_name]/[color_correction_filter_name]/gamma [-3 thru 3]`** 
- Adjust the Gamma of a source via the "Color Correction" filter in OBS of the current scene.
  - `0` is the default vaule
  - *Example:* `/Text_1/Color_Correction/gamma 3` will make "Text 1" gamma at highest setting. 
  - *Note:* If a source name or filter name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a source "Text 1" and filter "Color Correction" make OSC message the example from above)

### Contrast
**`/[source_name]/[color_correction_filter_name]/contrast [-2 thru 2]`** 
- Adjust the Contrast of a source via the "Color Correction" filter in OBS of the current scene.
  -  `0` is the default vaule

  - *Example:* `/Webcam_1/Text_1/position 0 0` this changes the source to center of the screen, as long as the alignment is cewnter. See "Qlab OSC Examples" file for how to automate positions.
  - *Note:* This is only tested for a "Canvas Size" of 1920x1080 in OBS. Also, If a scene name or source name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a scene "Webcam 1" and a source name of "Text 1" make OSC message the example from above.
#
## **- Translate Source's Scale: -**
#
**`/[scene_name]/[source_name]/scale [float]`**

  - *Example:* `/Webcam_1/Text_1/scale 2` this will make the size of the "Text 1" source double the size of original. 
  - *Note:* See "Qlab OSC Examples" file for how to automate scale. Also, If a scene name or source name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a scene "Webcam 1" and a source name of "Text 1" make OSC message the example from above.)
#
## **- Translate Source's Rotation: -**
#
**`/[scene_name]/[source_name]/rotate [float]`**
- change the source's scale. `0` is nothing, `360` is full 360 rotation clockwise. Negative numbers will rotate counterclockwise. Numbers larger than "360" will be more roations. 
  - *Example:* `/Webcam_1/Text_1/rotate 90` this will make the rotation of the "Text 1" source 90ยบ clockwise. 
  - *Note:* See "Qlab OSC Examples" file for how to automate rotation. Also, If a scene name or source name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a scene "Webcam 1" and a source name of "Text 1" make OSC message the example from above.)

  - *Note:* If you use `-1` or empty(`null`), then this would make a windowed projector of specified `[type]`
- `[sceneorsource_name]` is an **optional** for the 2nd argument. This can **ONLY** be used if using `Scene` or `Source` for `[type]`
  - This would be the name of a Source or Scene in OBS that would open a specified projector

#

# OBS -> Application:


- Configure "OSC OUT" to target Application

- When *Enabled* his allows OBS to send OSC to other applications when a scene is activated.

- To **use/enable** this function, change the toggle button to ON
Configure the prefix and suffix for how you want your OSC application to receive an OSC string from OBS

  - *Example:* In OBS when a Scene named "Wide" is activated, Qlab recieves an OSC message "**/cue/Wide/start**")
  - *Note:* This currently does NOT support any spaces.
